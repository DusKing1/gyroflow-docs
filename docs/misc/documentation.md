## Help with documentation

This site uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) and is formatted with Markdown. Here's how to serve a local version for editing purposes

1. Install MkDocs and Material for MkDocs: `pip install mkdocs-material`
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow-docs.git`
3. Run local server: `mkdocs serve`

Alternatively each page has an edit button which directly opens the GitHub online editor.

In general, create GitHub pull request to merge the edits.
