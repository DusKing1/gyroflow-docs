Rolling shutter artifacts are caused by camera sensors reading lines sequentially instead of simultaneously (global shutter). With the correct settings, Gyroflow is capable of correcting for rolling shutter artifacts.



## Frame readout time determination
There are multiple ways of determining the frame readout time. One approach is by recording a rapidly flashing source of light with a known frequency or pulse width, and analyzing the resulting image. For a known pulse width, the size of the bands can be used in order to find the frame readout time. For a known frequency, the number of bands can be counted.
Using LED's for rolling shutter measurements is described in this blog post: [https://joancharmant.com/blog/measuring-rolling-shutter-with-a-strobing-led/](https://joancharmant.com/blog/measuring-rolling-shutter-with-a-strobing-led/)
