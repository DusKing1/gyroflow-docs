# Contribute to Gyroflow

For contributing to the main Gyroflow program, refer to the [Github repository](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow). Feature requests can be submitted by opening issues, and new features can be added through pull requests.

Another way of contributing to the project is by helping translate the program to your language. This is done through _crowdin_: [https://crowdin.com/project/gyroflow](https://crowdin.com/project/gyroflow).

Currently *Gyroflow* is available in:

* **English** (base language)
* **Polish** (by [AdrianEddy](https://github.com/AdrianEddy))
* **German** (by [Grommi](https://github.com/Gro2mi) and [Nicecrash](https://github.com/B-nutze-RR))
* **Danish** (by [ElvinC](https://github.com/ElvinC))
* **Norwegian** (by [MiniGod](https://github.com/MiniGod) and [alexagv](https://github.com/alexagv))
* **Chinese Simplified** (by [DusKing1](https://github.com/DusKing1))
* **Chinese Traditional** (by [DusKing1](https://github.com/DusKing1))

Furthermore, you can contribute to the Gyroflow project by creating and submitting new lens profiles. This allows future users with the same hardware to start using the software right away.
