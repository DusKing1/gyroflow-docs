# Quick start guide for Gyroflow 1.0.0

1. Download the executable corresponding to your system: https://github.com/adrianeddy/gyroflow/releases
2. Run the executable.
3. Either open or drag your video file to Gyroflow.
4. Lens profile and motion data files are automatically detected for some cameras (GoPros). Otherwise search for the correct lens profile and open the motion data file.
5. Playback video to check if additional synchronization is required. If so, right-click on the timeline and select `Auto sync here` at at least two points of the video where some motion is present. This synchronises the gyro data and the video.
6. Play with the stabilization options and algorithms. They all give different "looks" for the final result.
7. Select output file settings and export.
