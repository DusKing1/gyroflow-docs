## General recording tips
* Use the settings that give the widest possible field of view (more data to work with). For a lot of cameras, this is in the 4:3 aspect ratio.
* If using the main drone flight controller for logging, the camera should be hardmounted.
* If using a secondary logger on the camera or internal camera logging, some soft mounting is preferred to isolate vibrations.
