## General recording tips
* Use the settings that give the widest possible field of view. This results in more data to work with. For a lot of cameras, this is using the 4:3 aspect ratio if available.
* If using the main flight controller on a drone for logging, the camera should be rigidly mounted to the drone.
* If using a secondary logger on the camera or internal camera logging, some soft mounting is preferred when used in a high-vibration environment (drones).
