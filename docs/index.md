# Welcome to the Gyroflow Docs!

**This site is currently under construction and will eventually house all the info in one place. See [gyroflow.xyz](http://gyroflow.xyz/) for now.**


## Run using python and Poetry:
Note: Try the dev branch for the newest features.

* Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
* Clone or download the files from this repo
* Navigate to the folder using a commandline and install dependencies using `poetry install`
* Run the application using `poetry run python gyroflow.py`

## General recording tips
* Use the settings that give the widest possible field of view (more data to work with). For a lot of cameras, this is in the 4:3 aspect ratio.
* If using the main drone flight controller for logging, the camera should be hardmounted.
* If using a secondary logger on the camera or internal camera logging, some soft mounting is preferred to isolate vibrations.
